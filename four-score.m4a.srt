00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,800
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,220
and so dedicated can long endure.

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,720
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,100
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,060
gave their lives that the nation might live.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:52,340
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
