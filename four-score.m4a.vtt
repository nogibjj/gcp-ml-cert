00:00.000 --> 00:08.120
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

00:08.120 --> 00:14.800
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

00:14.800 --> 00:21.000
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

00:21.000 --> 00:24.220
and so dedicated can long endure.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.720
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

00:26.720 --> 00:33.100
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

00:33.100 --> 00:36.060
gave their lives that the nation might live.

00:36.060 --> 00:52.340
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
